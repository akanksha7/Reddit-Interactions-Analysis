Unveiling the Dynamics of Reddit Subreddit Interactions: A Comprehensive Analysis of Semantic Content Evolution Over Time

Online communities, such as Reddit, serve as dynamic platforms for discussions, where content and sentiments evolve over time. This report presents an analysis of the Reddit Hyperlink Network Dataset spanning 2.5 years, focusing on understanding the temporal dynamics of semantic content within subreddits. Leveraging sentiment annotations, timestamps, and text property vectors, we investigate how sentiments and topics change over time and explore their influence on information diffusion and community dynamics. Our findings provide insights into discourse evolution, informing strategies for content moderation and community management on online platforms.

Key research questions include:
  ● How do semantic characteristics like sentiment  
  and topics change over time within subreddits?  
  ● What temporal trends, patterns, or variations exist  
  in subreddit discussions?  
  ● What factors contribute to temporal variations in  
  semantic content across subreddits?  
  ● How do these variations influence information  
  diffusion and community dynamics?  
  ● How can insights from this analysis inform  
  understanding of discourse evolution and predictive modeling?
